1. Start the development server (using WSL terminal):
```bash
bun run dev
```

2. Wait for the server to be ready (usually at http://localhost:5173).

3. Use the browser agent to verify the UI:
   - Navigate to the local development URL.
   - Check if the main page loads without errors.
   - Verify that recent style changes are reflected correctly.
   - Capture a screenshot if requested.

4. Report any issues found or confirm that the UI is working as expected.
